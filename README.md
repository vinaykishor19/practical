# practical question 1
Round-robin is one of the algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in computing. 
As the term is generally used, time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority.

Input

Number of processes
Arrival time of each process. If all process arrives at the same time, this can be set to 0 for all processes.
Burst time of each process
Time quantum

Output

Start Time(ST), Completion Time(CT), Turnaround Time(TAT), Waiting Time(WT) and Response Time(RT) for each process.
Average turnaround Time, average waiting time and average response time.
Throughput and cpu utilization.

#practical question 2
In Operating System, the fork() system call is used by a process to create another process.
The process that used the fork() system call is the parent process and process consequently created is known as the child process.
